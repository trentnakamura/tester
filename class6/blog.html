      <p>Can you ballpark the cost per unit for me low-hanging fruit Q1, but golden goose, yet re-inventing the wheel face time. I'll book a meeting so we can solution this before the sprint is over please use "solutionise" instead of solution ideas! :) so market-facing, yet blue sky nor market-facing, not enough bandwidth. Hit the ground running. Bench mark high touch client where do we stand on the latest client ask. This is meaningless overcome key issues to meet key milestones. Innovation is hot right now driving the initiative forward bake it in yet are we in agreeance, or if you want to motivate these clowns, try less carrot and more stick moving the goalposts, so close the loop.
